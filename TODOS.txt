Critical Bugs


  Potential Bugs


  Performance Enhancement Opportunities


  10. Query Cache Key Generation (src/core/Table.ts:508-523)

  - Uses toString() and string slicing for function hashing
  - Inefficient and unreliable for cache keys
  - Improvement: Better cache hit rates

  Code Quality Issues

  11. Error Handling Inconsistency

  - Some functions throw errors, others return null/false
  - Inconsistent error types across similar operations
  - Impact: Developer experience and debugging

  12. Magic Numbers (src/utils/BTree.ts:20-22)

  - Hardcoded values like MAX_KEYS = 15, NODE_SIZE = 1024
  - Should be configurable or documented with rationale
  - Impact: Maintainability

  13. Async/Sync Method Mixing

  - Storage interface mixes sync and async methods
  - Can lead to blocking operations in async contexts
  - Impact: Performance and UX

  Security Concerns

  14. File Path Validation Missing

  - No validation of user-provided file paths in storage constructors
  - Could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities
  - Risk: Medium - unauthorized file access

  15. Lock File Permissions (src/storage/WALStorage.ts:154-191)

  - Lock files created with default permissions
  - Could be accessible by other users on system
  - Risk: Low - information disclosure
