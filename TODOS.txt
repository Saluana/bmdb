  Performance Enhancement Opportunities

  Code Quality Issues

  11. Error Handling Inconsistency

  - Some functions throw errors, others return null/false
  - Inconsistent error types across similar operations
  - Impact: Developer experience and debugging

  12. Magic Numbers (src/utils/BTree.ts:20-22)

  - Hardcoded values like MAX_KEYS = 15, NODE_SIZE = 1024
  - Should be configurable or documented with rationale
  - Impact: Maintainability

  13. Async/Sync Method Mixing

  - Storage interface mixes sync and async methods
  - Can lead to blocking operations in async contexts
  - Impact: Performance and UX

  Security Concerns

  14. File Path Validation Missing

  - No validation of user-provided file paths in storage constructors
  - Could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities
  - Risk: Medium - unauthorized file access

  15. Lock File Permissions (src/storage/WALStorage.ts:154-191)

  - Lock files created with default permissions
  - Could be accessible by other users on system
  - Risk: Low - information disclosure

  Recommendations Priority

  High Priority:
  - Fix race condition in ID generation (#1)
  - Implement proper WAL lock backoff (#3)
  - Add file path validation (#14)

  Medium Priority:
  - Fix BTree cache eviction (#4)
  - Improve error handling consistency (#11)
  - Optimize WAL batching (#8)

  Low Priority:
  - Optimize B-tree serialization (#7)
  - Improve LRU cache implementation (#9)
  - Document magic numbers (#12)

  Based on the performance analysis, I can see the main bottlenecks. Current performance
  shows:

  Memory: 6-720K ops/sec (huge variance)
  JSON: 140-268 ops/secWAL: 39-148 ops/sec

  The main issues are:
  1. structuredClone() overhead in JSON storage
  2. Full DB read/write cycles for single operations
  3. No connection pooling or caching
  4. Inefficient B-tree operations
  5. No batch optimization usage

  Performance Optimization Plan (10x minimum improvement target):

  Phase 3: I/O & Serialization
  - Replace JSON with MessagePack for faster serialization
  - Add memory-mapped file access for binary storage
  - Implement streaming operations for large datasets
  - Add write batching for WAL storage

  Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations
  - Implement lazy loading with pagination
  - Add background WAL compaction
  - Optimize vector search with better indexing
  - Add parallel query execution

  This should achieve 10x+ improvement across all storage modes by targeting the specific
  bottlenecks identified in each storage implementation.
