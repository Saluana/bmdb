# BMDB Performance Evaluation Results

Generated: 2025-05-24T14:47:00.237Z

## Test Environment
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 23.1.0)
- **Test Dataset**: 1000 documents with nested objects
- **Document Structure**: ID, name, email, age, active status

## Storage Implementations Tested

### 1. Memory Storage
Pure in-memory storage with no persistence. Provides baseline performance metrics.

### 2. JSON Storage
Traditional JSON file-based storage with immediate persistence to disk.

### 3. WAL Storage (MVCC)
Write-Ahead Log with Multi-Version Concurrency Control, providing ACID transactions and crash safety.

## Performance Results

| Operation | Memory Storage | JSON Storage | WAL Storage | Performance Impact |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Insert 1000 docs** | 641 ops/sec | 599 ops/sec | 336 ops/sec | WAL: -47% vs Memory |
| **Read 100 docs** | 22,435 ops/sec | 58,404 ops/sec | 34,111 ops/sec | WAL: +52% vs Memory |
| **Update 100 docs** | 422 ops/sec | 303 ops/sec | 166 ops/sec | WAL: -61% vs Memory |

### Transaction-Specific Performance

| Operation | WAL Storage | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Transactions** | 3,265 tx/sec | 30.6ms for 100 transactions |
| **Concurrent Reads** | 243,415 reads/sec | During active transaction |
| **WAL Overhead** | 303 entries | For 1000 inserts + 100 updates |

## Detailed Analysis

### Write Performance
- **Memory Storage**: 641 ops/sec (baseline)
- **JSON Storage**: 599 ops/sec (6% slower than memory)
- **WAL Storage**: 336 ops/sec (47% slower than memory)

**Analysis**: WAL storage pays a significant write penalty due to:
1. Write-ahead logging to `.wal` file
2. Transaction overhead (begin/commit operations)
3. MVCC snapshot creation
4. File I/O for both WAL and data persistence

### Read Performance
- **Memory Storage**: 22,435 ops/sec (baseline)
- **JSON Storage**: 58,404 ops/sec (160% faster than memory!)
- **WAL Storage**: 34,111 ops/sec (52% faster than memory)

**Analysis**: Surprisingly, persistent storage outperforms memory for reads because:
1. JSON/WAL storages cache data in memory after initial load
2. No deep cloning overhead (memory storage clones for safety)
3. Optimized read paths in persistent storage implementations

### Update Performance
- **Memory Storage**: 422 ops/sec (baseline)
- **JSON Storage**: 303 ops/sec (28% slower than memory)
- **WAL Storage**: 166 ops/sec (61% slower than memory)

**Analysis**: Updates show the true cost of persistence:
1. WAL must log every update operation
2. JSON storage writes entire file on each update
3. Transaction overhead becomes apparent under write load

## MVCC & Transaction Benefits

### Transaction Throughput
- **3,265 transactions/second** for simple operations
- **30.6ms** to complete 100 individual transactions
- Minimal overhead per transaction (~0.3ms)

### Concurrent Read Performance
- **243,415 reads/second** during active transactions
- Readers never block writers (MVCC benefit)
- Consistent snapshot isolation

### Crash Safety Features
- **Write-Ahead Logging**: All operations logged before execution
- **Point-in-time Recovery**: Historical snapshots available
- **ACID Guarantees**: Full transaction rollback capability
- **Monotonic Transaction IDs**: 102 transactions processed, 101 stable

## Performance Trade-offs

### When to Use Each Storage

| Storage Type | Best For | Trade-offs |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Memory** | • Caching<br>• Temporary data<br>• High-performance reads | • No persistence<br>• Data loss on restart |
| **JSON** | • Simple applications<br>• Low write volume<br>• Human-readable data | • Poor concurrent write performance<br>• Full file rewrites |
| **WAL** | • Production systems<br>• High reliability needs<br>• Concurrent workloads | • Higher write latency<br>• More complex implementation |

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**WAL Storage Premium**:
- 47% slower writes
- 61% slower updates
- **But gains**:
  - Crash safety and recovery
  - ACID transaction support
  - High concurrent read performance
  - Point-in-time snapshots

## Recommendations

### For Development
Use **Memory Storage** for:
- Unit tests
- Prototyping
- Cache implementations

### For Simple Applications
Use **JSON Storage** for:
- Configuration storage
- Small datasets (< 10K records)
- Single-user applications

### For Production Systems
Use **WAL Storage** for:
- Multi-user applications
- Financial/critical data
- Systems requiring transactions
- High-concurrency read workloads

## Technical Implementation Notes

### WAL Architecture
- **Monotonic Transaction IDs**: Ensures ordering and consistency
- **Single Writer Lock**: Prevents write conflicts (SQLite-style)
- **MVCC Snapshots**: Each committed transaction creates a snapshot
- **Stable Transaction Tracking**: Readers use highest stable txid

### Performance Optimization Opportunities
1. **Batch Transactions**: Group operations for better throughput
2. **WAL Compaction**: Periodic cleanup reduces file size
3. **Read-Only Transactions**: Could eliminate locking overhead
4. **Async I/O**: Background WAL writes could improve latency

## Conclusion

The WAL implementation successfully provides **ACID guarantees and crash safety** with acceptable performance costs. While write operations are 47% slower than memory storage, the benefits of data integrity, transaction support, and excellent concurrent read performance make it suitable for production use cases requiring reliability over raw speed.

The **3,265 transactions/second** throughput and **243,415 concurrent reads/second** demonstrate that the MVCC implementation scales well for read-heavy workloads while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
